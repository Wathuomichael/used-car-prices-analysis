# Summary
The analysis was focused on discovering what variables have a significant impact on used car pricing. The model used was a linear regression which had an r-squared of 0.91 which indicates that the model was a good fit. Highly significant variables included: Year of manufacture, seller type(individual or dealer), transmission(automatic or manual), fuel type(petrol or diesel) and the listed price.

# Introduction
The aim of this analysis was to determine the factors that had the most effect on used car prices and also predict selling price of used cars given new data.

# Findings

Majority of the carsâ€™ selling price was below 10 lakh and the mean selling price was 4.7 lakh. There were however some observations that were above 30 lakh which indicated presence of outliers that could have an effect on the model fit.

The above plot shows relationship between selling price and fuel type. Diesel cars are generally more expensive than petrol cars. There are only 2 observations of CNG powered cars hence we cannot make accurate assessments on CNG fuel type.

Mileage(Kms_Driven) does not seem to have a significant impact on selling price according to the plot above. Transmission appears to have a small impact on selling price as automatic cars seem to be more pricey compared to their manual counterparts as also shown by the plot below.
